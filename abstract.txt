Bincrafters - Your Open-Source Devops Team for Conan and C/C++

Description
Conan provides a unified dependency management experience for C and C++ libraries, which includes both pre-compiled binary management and build-from-source automation across all platforms.  So, how do thousands of C and C++ libraries get converted into Conan packages?  Well... it's lots of work.  While Conan provides tremendous flexibility in automating the build processes of libraries, C and C++ build processes are notoriously complex.  So, someone still has to encapsulate the complexity for each library within a Conan recipe, and test it across all platforms.  As a result, it requires significant skill, experience, and time to create robust and reliable packages.  For this reason, an OSS team known as Bincrafters has emerged from the Conan community to help lead the charge on the massive packaging effort that is needed.  In this talk, we'll provide an overview of the progress we've made so far along with our roadmap and goals for the future.  We'll share the details of the Bincrafters devops pipeline which powers our work, as well as some lessons learned. We'll highlight some of our most active members, and the support of sponsors we have so far.  Finally, we'll share some options for anyone else wishing to support the Bincrafters team and efforts in the future.
